# Character-Creator

Live Site: https://matamata.org/Character-Creator/

This is a very basic program to help create the `character.json` file more efficiently. In it's current implementation, this can only do poses and not placeable parts, those would need to be manually added later.

This is just the previously deprecate version of CharacterCreator updated to the new character.json schema. Ideally, this tool would be completely rebuilt but I do not have the time.
